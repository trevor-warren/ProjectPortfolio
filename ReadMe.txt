Each directory contains a portfolio of projects for different types of projects.
Instructions tailored for each type of project have been put in ReadMe files in each
category's directory, and each project will have its own ReadMe to describe its purpose
and how to use it.

Projects that cannot run outside of their respective environments
have code available in standalone files for ease of access.
