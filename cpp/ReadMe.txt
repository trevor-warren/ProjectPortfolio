All of the projects in this directory are currently compiled using MS Visual Studio.
GameEngine and TerrainConverter are compiled with any version that has C++17, but all the others should work with C++11.

This ReadMe will be updated if any projects are added that use makefiles or other alternative build systems.

ReadMes will be added to other projects as I update my portfolio more. I'd prefer that the purpose and
usage of these projects be as unambiguous and clear as possible. In the future I will also probably add
precompiled builds of these projects for easier use as I get more time to expand my portfolio.
