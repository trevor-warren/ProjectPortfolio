These projects were made in Roblox's IDE called Roblox Studio and are designed to run in this environment.
The source code has been provided in standalone .lua files for ease of access, but they are not designed to
work outside of Roblox's engine.

Roblox Studio is available on Roblox's website https://www.roblox.com/ and may be downloaded by attempting
to play any game on https://www.roblox.com/games/. The site will prompt you with a download, and once the
Roblox client is installed and you are logged in the website is no longer required for use.

Roblox's game client and Roblox Studio are stored in the /Local/ directory of your user's /AppData/ in
Windows in case you need to manually uninstall it.

An account is required to use Roblox Studio as of a few years ago, and I believe offline
mode isn't supported.

Instructions for how to use the necessary features of Roblox Studio to test the
project will be added to the ReadMes of each project along with links to YouTube videos showcasing
their features.
